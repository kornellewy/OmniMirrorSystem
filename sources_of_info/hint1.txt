Have built systems, RAG needs a lot of work and RAG is unliky to be the only or the best solution. "retrieval" is the hardest part of RAG.

    But there is a lot to improve about the generated recomendations, conclusions, filtering, best results, ...

Yes, it is trivial to get a "working" version. Lot of work to get a "usable" product.

What worked :

    Using multiple retrievers.

    Use LLM to process the query and identify retrievers (I.e. if Query is better served from DB, route to different code. Like if product price is already in some DB)

    Combine results with Text search like Elastic Search

    Use a combination of small chunks and large chunks

    "Decorate" chunks with metadata as much as possible . Say if product IDs are in DB, add that info to chunk

    Use PDF parsers that understand tables

For your usecase, since PDFs aer 1 or 2 pages, maybe using PDF-to-Html might work. Easier to extract formatting and tables from html.
